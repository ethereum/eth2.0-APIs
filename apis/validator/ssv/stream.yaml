  summary: Stream of attestations to sign from SSV node
  tags:
    - SSV
  description: |
    Provides endpoint to subscribe to attestations to sign from an SSV node. Only provided by SSV nodes.
    Two types of events: 
      "sign_*": Attestations/blocks should be signed and sent to the appropriate beacon node API for publication
      "check_*": Message should be checked for conflicts with slashing protection; response to be sent to approve_* endpoint
    Consumers should use [eventsource](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-eventsource-interface)
    implementation to listen on those events.
