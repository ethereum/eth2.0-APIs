    Register a new password to be used to encrypt the local wallet. The password MUST:

    Be stored locally hashed with salt to authenticate future logins.
    Be used to encrypt and decrypt the local representation of the imported keystores
    The validator binary MUST expose a CLI argument --persist-password to enable persisting
    the password such that it can be restarted and perform validator duties without requiring
    interaction by the user.
